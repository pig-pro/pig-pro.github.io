	<p> Also, the pets that i talked about can become neon or mega, i will tell you what they are now. Basically there is a main bridge in adopt me, and under the bridge, there is a door,  go in the door. you will see four circles on the ground, place four of the same pet that are full grown to make neon, if you want to make mega, put four of the same full grown neon pets. neon basically make your pet sparkle on some part, but neon is only one color, but mega swithches colors.
